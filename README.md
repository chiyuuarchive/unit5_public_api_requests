 Public API Requests

In this project, a random person generator and image generator API have been used to develop an employee directory. The javascript file "script.js" features asynchrounous JavaScript programming mostly dealing with handling of async operations with promises. 12 employees are randomely generated in this directory with the user being able to search and generate modal windows of selected employee.

For the "exceed expectations" grade, the background color of the webpage has been changed to a light blue color. In addition, a random image generator API (source: "https://picsum.photos/") has been utilized to decorate the header of the webpage.
